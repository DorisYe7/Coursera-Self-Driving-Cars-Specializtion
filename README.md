# Coursera-Self-Driving-Cars-Specializtion
Projects for the specialization course Self Driving Cars in Coursera

The SDCs specialization consists of four courses:
Course 1 Introduction to SDCs: introduces the terminology, design specifications, and safety assessment of SDCs. 
  Goal: 
    - be able to understand and identify the hardware and the software components for the SDCs
    - be able to simulate the vehicle model and control
    - be able to analyze the safety protocal and industry practices
  Final Project:
    Develop code to navigate a self-driving car around a racetrack in the CARLA simulation environment
    
Course 2 State Estimation and Localization for SDCs: introduce the state estimation and localization for SDCs using different sensors
  Goal:
    - be able to understand the parameter and state estimation methods, such as the method of least squares
    - be able to construct models for localization senosor
    - be able to apply the extended and unscented Kalman Filters to a state estimation problem
    - be able to understand LIDAR sensing algorithm
    - be able to utilize sensor fusion and calibration
  Final Project:
    Implement Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) to localize a vehicle using data from the CARLA simulator
  
Course 3 Visual Perception for SDCs: 


Course 4 Motion Planning for SDCs
